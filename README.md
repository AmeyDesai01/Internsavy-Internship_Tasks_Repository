**Repository: Internship at InternSavy - Data Science Intern**

### Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my internship as a Data Science Intern at InternSavy. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on several exciting data science projects that involved data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. This README provides an overview of the tasks I completed during the internship.

### Tasks

**Task 1: Graduate Admissions Prediction**
- *Objective*: Use classification techniques to predict Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.
- *Description*: In this task, I worked on building a predictive model for Graduate Admissions. The model used various features to predict the likelihood of admission based on the Indian education system.

**Task 2: Customer Clustering with Machine Learning**
- *Objective*: Apply clustering techniques to a customer dataset.
- *Description*: Task 2 involved using machine learning to segment customers based on their behavior and characteristics. Clustering techniques were used to group customers with similar profiles, enabling more targeted marketing strategies.

**Task 3: Customer Segmentation Analysis**
- *Objective*: Perform customer segmentation analysis using Python.
- *Description*: Task 3 was focused on understanding customer segments by analyzing their demographics, preferences, and behaviors. Python was used for data analysis and visualization to derive actionable insights.

**Task 4: Cricket Player Performance Prediction**
- *Objective*: Predict cricket player performance using machine learning.
- *Description*: In this task, I developed a machine learning model to predict the performance of cricket players. The model considered various factors and statistics to provide insights into player performance.
